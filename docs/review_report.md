# Secure Coding Review Report

## Overview

This document outlines the findings from the secure coding review conducted on the Flask web application. The application was analyzed to identify common security vulnerabilities, and recommendations have been provided to enhance its security posture.

## Findings

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability

- **Location**: `Vulnerable_App/app.py` - Login function
- **Description**: User input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without validation or parameterization.
- **Impact**: This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data theft, data corruption, or unauthorized access.
- **Recommendation**: Utilize parameterized queries or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) methods to safely handle user input.

#### Example Mitigation
Instead of:
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}' AND password = '{}'".format(username, password)
```
Use:
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
conn.execute(query, (username, password))
```

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Location**: `Vulnerable_App/templates/user_profile`
- **Description**: User input is rendered directly in HTML without proper escaping.
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute malicious scripts in users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement.
- **Recommendation**: Rely on Flask’s templating engine which automatically escapes data, preventing XSS attacks.

#### Example Mitigation
Ensure all dynamic content is passed through Flask’s `render_template` or `render_template_string` functions, which handle escaping automatically.

### 3. Insecure Password Storage

- **Location**: `Vulnerable_App/setup_db.py`
- **Description**: User passwords are stored in plaintext within the database.
- **Impact**: If the database is compromised, attackers can access all user passwords, potentially using them for further attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Hash passwords using a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt before storing them in the database.

#### Example Mitigation
Utilize Python's `bcrypt` library to hash passwords:
```python
import bcrypt

hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
```

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Use HTTPS**: Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, ensuring secure communication between clients and the server.
2. **Security Headers**: Introduce security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options to protect against various attacks.
3. **Input Validation**: Implement robust input validation to ensure all data entrusted to the application meets defined criteria before processing.

## Conclusion

Addressing the identified vulnerabilities is crucial for converting this application into a robust, secure service. Implementing the recommended changes will significantly bolster the security and integrity of the application, protecting both data and users from potential threats.
